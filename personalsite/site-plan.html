      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to make a website where I can post pictures of nature and animals. Basically, a picture blog. There would be pages separating landscapes, animals, and other photos. I think it would be cool to have a place to share some photos I’ve taken of some nearby national parks. My unique selling point would be the fact that the pictures are all unique

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This is a blog type site where I can post photos of nature I have taken. I have numerous photos I’ve taken over the years and think this is the perfect place to share them. I would also like to share little stories alongside the photos or context of where it was taken and why I took it. Hopefully anyone visiting the site will enjoy the photos and keep coming back to see any updates posted. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Questions I expect to be asked will hopefully be answered by the little stories attached to each image. Otherwise, I’m not 100% sure what kind of questions may be asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activities are looking at photos, and reading stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        People will come to my site because it has photos that they wouldn’t see anywhere else. All of the photos I will have taken personally and don’t appear anywhere else.
